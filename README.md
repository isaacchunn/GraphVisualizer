# Unity Visualisations

- This repository contains the visualisations I've prototyped and implemented in Unity using C# and HLSL. The visualisations are just ways to see how it comes together and practice my coding skills.

| Sierpinski's Triangle |The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles  |
|Diffusion-limited aggregation|**Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)** is the process whereby particles undergoing a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk "Random walk") due to [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion") cluster together to form aggregates of such particles.|
|Hamiltonian Path Finder|In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") field of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), a **Hamiltonian path** (or **traceable path**) is a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") in an undirected or directed graph that visits each [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") exactly once. A **Hamiltonian cycle** (or **Hamiltonian circuit**) is a [cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) "Cycle (graph theory)") that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at adjacent vertices can be completed by adding one more edge to form a Hamiltonian cycle, and removing any edge from a Hamiltonian cycle produces a Hamiltonian path. The computational problems of determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs (the [Hamiltonian path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem "Hamiltonian path problem") and [Hamiltonian cycle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_cycle_problem "Hamiltonian cycle problem")) are [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete "NP-complete").|
